# LOLBAS: mshta.exe – Inline Script Execution (Javascript / VBScript)
# Technique: T1218.005 (mshta), T1059 (Script Execution)

# 1) Inline Javascript execution (fires 995003)
mshta.exe "javascript:WScript.Echo('test from mshta')"

# 2) Inline VBScript execution (fires 995003)
# Note: May not visibly pop a MsgBox on all systems, but still logs telemetry.
mshta.exe "vbscript:MsgBox(\"test from mshta\")"

# Purpose:
# Simulates attackers abusing mshta.exe to execute script directly through
# javascript: or vbscript:, enabling fileless payload delivery.
