# Attack Simulation Commands

This folder contains the exact commands I used to trigger the detection rules in my Wazuh + Sysmon lab.

All commands were executed on the Windows endpoint (Sysmon installed, Wazuh agent installed).
Each command corresponds to a specific MITRE ATT&CK technique and was used to validate rule behavior.

These are not malware samples, only command-line based simulations for testing process creation, parent-child behavior, and correlation logic.
